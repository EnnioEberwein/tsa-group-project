# Time Series Analysis and Machine Learning - Assignment 1

This assignment explores parameter selection and dimensionality reduction techniques in regression, including ridge regularization and principal-component-analysis with reproducible R implementations.

The repository contains our group’s submission for **Assignment 1** of the *Time Series Analysis and Machine Learning* course (BSc International Business Administration, WHU – Otto Beisheim School of Management).

## 📄 Overview

The assignment is based on Chapter 6 of *An Introduction to Statistical Learning (2nd ed.)* by James et al. (2021).  
Our work focuses on:

1. **Empirical Exercise** – Replicating the two panels of **Figure 6.4** using Base R.  
2. **Theoretical Exercise** – Explaining in detail how the two lines in **Figure 6.14** are derived, their interpretation, and why they are orthogonal.

The analysis and discussion are presented in an RMarkdown document (`Assignment1.Rmd`), which can be compiled into PDF format directly on the WHU RStudio server.
